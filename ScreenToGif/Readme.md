## What's new? (Version 2.15.2)

• Updated the Russian, Italian and Dutch translations.  

### Fixed:

♦ The Apng export option was not working properly, the transparency and the repeat mode were broken.
♦ When selecting a folder to save a Apng file, only the extension *.apng was being displayed (the extension *.png was left behind).  
♦ The keyboard shortcuts for the recording were not working when in fullscreen mode. 

### Known Bugs:

♠ Using an automated task to add the key strokes will still use the color and font settings from the main settings.
