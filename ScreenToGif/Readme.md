_VS 2017 and .Net 4.6.1 or newer required._


## What's new? (Version 2.18)

• Keystrokes: The app will display "Ctrl" instead of diplaying "Control".

### Fixed:

♦   

### Known Bugs:

♠ Using an automated task to add the key strokes will still use the color and font settings from the main settings.  
♠ When importing multiple images with different sizes at the same time, the app does not ask to resize all images to the same size.   
♠ When exporting with FFmpeg, the last frame may be out of sync with the timmings of the project.  
♠ With the new recorder UI: The Accept/Retry/Cancel commands are overflowing to the left when the selection is too small and to the left.
